# Background and Purpose

## Background

I (Yuki) run a newsletter and YouTube channel focused on **career strategies and skill acquisition methods for engineers**.

- **Newsletter** systematically covers topics like "escaping SES (System Engineering Services)", "acquiring high-paying projects", "efficient skill learning", and "career planning", leading to course purchases and long-term fan development
- **YouTube channel** delivers video content on themes that interest engineers: programming, career development, workplace navigation, and cutting-edge technologies

**Current challenges:**
- Want to increase YouTube subscribers and drive them to newsletter signup
- Need to quickly identify "trending themes" and leverage them for video production
- It's impossible to manually track "which themes are trending" from the massive volume of videos posted daily

## Purpose

- **Ultimate goal**: Increase newsletter subscribers and cultivate fans who will purchase educational materials
- **Strategy**: Increase YouTube views → grow subscribers → guide subscribers to newsletter
- **Tool's role**: Become a radar that can quantitatively discover "what themes to create videos on for growth"

## Target Genres

- Primarily **Engineer/Career-focused**
- Technical: Go, React, AWS, Docker, GitHub, Python, GCP, etc.
- Career: Engineer job changes, SES escape, freelancing, career transitions from SIer
- AI/Latest tech: Claude, ChatGPT, AI tool utilization

## Expected Benefits

This system will enable:

1. **Data-driven decision making on "what themes will make YouTube grow right now?"**
2. **Automatic tracking of countless videos beyond human capability, never missing "rapidly growing themes"**
3. **As a result**:
   - YouTube views and subscribers increase
   - Subscribers flow into newsletter
   - Fan development leading to course purchases accelerates
