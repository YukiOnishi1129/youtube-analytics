# Automated Processes (Batch/Background Operations)

## Trending Video Collection
- Daily collection of trending videos from "Education" and "Science & Technology" categories at scheduled times
- Check if titles contain keywords like "Engineer" and "React"
- Add only videos that meet the criteria to the "monitoring list"

## Immediate Registration Upon Finding New Videos
- Notifications are received when monitored channels publish videos
- Immediately save initial video data (views, likes, etc.)
- Register check schedules for "3 hours later, 6 hours later, 24 hours later..." in the calendar

## Fetch Data Again After Time Passes
- Automatically fetch the latest data for the video at the scheduled time
- Record "how much the view count has increased" and other metrics

## Calculate Growth Rates
- Calculate, for example, "how much the view count increased from 0 to 24 hours"
- Calculate "whether views are growing relative to subscriber count" and "like rate"
- Organize and save results in a "format usable for rankings"

## Subscription Renewal
- Channel monitoring expires after a certain period, so renewal procedures are automatically performed daily

## Ranking History Preservation
- Save "Top 10 videos that grew the most in the last 24 hours" every morning
- Enable retrospective analysis like "this video grew the most in the first week of June"
